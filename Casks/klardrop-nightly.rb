# TEMPLATE for the rolling nightly cask. The nightly workflow (release-nightly.yml)
# renders 1.0.0-nightly.945 (full pre-release semver, so `brew upgrade` sees each new build),
# 17925094193ecb60ed8e4c74d690aa5dee3712b702aa48a77dac1ea04c2ab88b (the published DMG's checksum) and klardrop-1.0.0.dmg (the version-stamped DMG filename),
# then pushes the result to the tap as Casks/klardrop-nightly.rb.
#
# Install:  brew install --cask carlonzo/klardrop/klardrop-nightly
#
# Separate token from the stable `klardrop` cask so a tester can track nightly without
# clobbering a stable install. ponytail: assumes the nightly DMG is notarized (Apple
# secrets present) — an unsigned nightly installs but Gatekeeper blocks first launch.
