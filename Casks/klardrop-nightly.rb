# TEMPLATE for the rolling nightly cask. The nightly workflow (release-nightly.yml)
# renders 1.0.0-nightly.912 (full pre-release semver, so `brew upgrade` sees each new build),
# c4bd792e32f2557aaecba9e7cdd9a0c5ae711d7bae324fca6d78c6427c056da1 (the published DMG's checksum) and klardrop-1.0.0.dmg (the version-stamped DMG filename),
# then pushes the result to the tap as Casks/klardrop-nightly.rb.
#
# Install:  brew install --cask carlonzo/klardrop/klardrop-nightly
#
# Separate token from the stable `klardrop` cask so a tester can track nightly without
# clobbering a stable install. ponytail: assumes the nightly DMG is notarized (Apple
# secrets present) — an unsigned nightly installs but Gatekeeper blocks first launch.
